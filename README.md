# Hangman - Rite of Words and Life
Hangman - Rite of Words and Life is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. 
The main goal of this game is for the user to guess a random word that the computer chooses by guessing one letter at the time. This project was inspired by the blackboard game you played while in primary school and is suited for one or more players.
